Project-That-Uses-A-Lot-Of-Data-To-Do-Nothing
=============================================

A project that uses a lot of data to do nothing

This project will take NYTimes headlines, scour Yummly for an appropriate recipe for said headlines, search Google for where you can buy the ingredients, maps out a route to all those locations, and from Spotify generates a playlist to listen to during the travel time.
